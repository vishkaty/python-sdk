"""Post-generation fixes for constraints datamodel-code-generator ignores.

Eight constraint families are handled:

* ``minProperties`` / ``maxProperties`` on an object schema WITH declared
  properties are dropped by the generator: every field is optional, so an
  empty instance (or, for ``maxProperties``, an over-full one) passes
  validation in violation of the schema. ``minProperties`` support (issue
  #49, PR #55) never grew a ``maxProperties`` counterpart, so
  ``location_serves.json``'s ``maxProperties: 1`` ("the Platform MUST
  supply exactly one target form") went unenforced even though its sibling
  ``minProperties: 1`` on the same schema was already caught. (Either bound
  on a free-form object property is already handled natively — the
  generator maps it to ``Field(min_length=..., max_length=...)`` on the
  dict field.) The script scans the preprocessed schemas for root-level
  ``minProperties``/``maxProperties`` constraints and injects a
  ``model_validator(mode="after")`` into the matching generated classes,
  one validator per bound so both can coexist on the same class. JSON
  Schema counts the keys present on the object, so the validator counts
  provided fields (``model_fields_set``) unioned with extra keys
  (``model_extra``) — an explicit null is a present key, and unknown keys on
  ``extra="allow"`` models count too.

* ``contains`` / ``minContains`` / ``maxContains`` on an array schema is likewise
  dropped by the generator: ``totals.json`` requires *exactly one* ``subtotal``
  *and exactly one* ``total`` entry, but the generated ``Totals`` is a bare
  ``list[Total]`` alias, so an empty array (or one missing either required entry,
  or with duplicates) validates in violation of the schema. An array root is
  emitted as a ``TypeAliasType`` wrapping ``Annotated[list[...], ...]`` rather
  than a ``BaseModel`` subclass, so ``model_validator`` cannot apply; this script
  instead injects a module-level counting function, threaded into the alias
  metadata as a ``pydantic.AfterValidator``. Every predicate is derived from
  ``contains.properties.<field>.const`` — nothing is hard-coded — and one function
  enforces *all* of a schema's contains bounds.

  The pristine (pre-preprocessing) schemas are read for this: ``totals.json``
  carries its two containment rules as two ``allOf`` branches, and
  ``preprocess_schemas.py`` merges ``allOf`` into the root, where a JSON node can
  hold only one ``contains`` — so the second (``total``) would be lost if the
  preprocessed output were scanned. generate_models.sh snapshots the originals to
  ``ucp/raw_schemas`` before preprocessing for exactly this reason. The bound is
  applied to the base model and to its generated request variants (linked by file
  stem), and travels wherever the alias is reused as a field type.

* ``propertyNames`` on an object WITH named ``properties`` is not enforced. Such
  a schema is emitted as a ``BaseModel(extra="allow")`` with the named fields, so
  unknown (extra) keys are accepted without being checked against the declared
  key pattern (``signals.json`` requires reverse-domain keys, yet a malformed
  extra key validates). The script scans for objects that declare
  ``propertyNames`` AND carry named ``properties`` and injects a
  ``model_validator(mode="after")`` that matches every ``model_extra`` key against
  the pattern. The pattern is read from the source schema (inline or via ``$ref``
  to e.g. ``reverse_domain_name.json``), never duplicated here. An object with
  ``propertyNames`` but *no* named properties is emitted as a ``dict[KeyType, V]``
  whose key type already carries the pattern, so it is out of scope.

* ``uniqueItems`` on an array is dropped entirely by the generator, so a list
  field accepts duplicate entries in violation of the schema. The script
  collects the names of array properties declared with ``uniqueItems`` and
  injects a ``field_validator(mode="after")`` into each generated class that
  declares a matching list field.

* Simple conditional ``required`` constraints are dropped: pagination requires
  ``cursor`` when ``has_next_page`` is true, but the generated response model
  always treats it as optional. The script accepts only an unambiguous single
  required discriminator using ``const``/``enum`` and a ``then.required`` list,
  then injects a ``model_validator(mode="after")``. More complex conditions are
  skipped rather than approximated.

* Conditional numeric bounds are dropped for the same reason: ``total.json``
  requires a ``discount`` amount to be negative and a ``tax`` amount to be
  non-negative via if/then branches, but the generated ``Total`` carries no
  validator, so a positive discount validates. These rules are carried as
  ``allOf`` branches, which have no sibling ``properties`` of their own, so the
  scan validates them against the enclosing object's property set. A rule whose
  fields were stripped by request-variant projection is inapplicable rather than
  malformed and is skipped silently.

* ``additionalProperties: false`` on an object schema with named properties is
  normally overridden by the generator's ``--extra-fields=allow`` flag. The
  script detects schemas with ``additionalProperties: false`` and flips their
  generated ``model_config`` to ``extra="forbid"`` while preserving
  ``extra="allow"`` on sibling models in the same module.

Runs from generate_models.sh between generation and formatting; idempotent.
